# hyper-monokai-light

> monokai colors on bright background ðŸ’–

A [hyper.js](https://hyper.is/) theme ported from my all-time favorite theme by [rjfranco](https://github.com/rjfranco/monokai-light).
Find the source on [github](https://github.com/anoff/hyper-monokai-light).

In case you also happen to use Visual Studio Code you might also like to get the [monokai light theme for vscode](https://github.com/anoff/vscode-monokai-light).

Use it in your hyper terminal by adding it to the config `~/hyper.js`
```js
plugins: [
    'hyper-monokai-light'
  ]
```
